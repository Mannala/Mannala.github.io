Our measures are based on the average statutory tax rate, which accounts for the statutory tax rates across all transactions of a firm. We illustrate and validate our measures using simulation data, the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, changes in tax rate avoidance and tax base avoidance across time, bonus depreciation time periods, several sample splits of U.S. multinational and domestic firms, differences across industries, and firms operating in tax haven locations. The measures allow regulators and researchers to gain insights into these two conceptually different tax avoidance strategies.","tags":["Tax Avoidance","Tax Rate Avoidance","Tax Base Avoidance","Average Statutory Tax Rates","Effective Tax Rates"],"title":"Measuring Corporate Tax Rate and Tax Base Avoidance of U.S.Domestic and U.S. Multinational Firms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["with Nathan Goldman","Niklas Lampenius","Suresh Radhakrishnan and Jose Elias Feres de Almeida  Revising for 2nd round submission to Contemporary Accounting Research"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604361600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604361600,"objectID":"d08681436054222442934d53f21aa3a1","permalink":"https://mannala.github.io/publication/fast-interpretation-number-48-fin48-disclosures-and-corporate-innovation/","publishdate":"2020-11-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fast-interpretation-number-48-fin48-disclosures-and-corporate-innovation/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we analyze the real effect of financial statement tax disclosures on corporate innovation activities. In 2007, the FASB issued FIN 48, which mandates the separate disclosure of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs). Tax credits for innovation comprise a significant portion of this reserve because of their higher likelihood of being disallowed by the IRS upon audit. Given that UTB disclosure increases IRS scrutiny and, in consequence, decrease the likelihood of receiving tax credits, we expect net present values of innovation to decrease. Using patent applications as a measure of corporate innovation, we employ a difference-in-difference research design with publicly listed U.S. firms as the treatment group and privately held U.S. firms as the control group. We hypothesize and find robust evidence that following the onset of FIN 48, the number of patent applications by publicly listed firms decreased. We also provide evidence that the decrease is attributable to incremental innovation, which is more subject to the UTB disclosure requirements, and we provide evidence that our findings are more concentrated amongst firms less likely to be audited by the IRS prior to FIN 48. Overall, our evidence provides support for the real effects of disclosures on innovation activities.","tags":["Uncertain tax positions","FIN 48","Radical Innovation","Incremental Innovation","Patents","Backward Citations"],"title":"FASB Interpretation Number 48 (FIN 48) Disclosures and Corporate Innovation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["with Tami Dinh and Marc Candreja"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1578009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578009600,"objectID":"add7b8d3f7f4081c38c721aa0636b0ed","permalink":"https://mannala.github.io/publication/professional_goodwill-impaiurments-und-managementwechsel-eine-vergleichende-empirische-analyse/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/professional_goodwill-impaiurments-und-managementwechsel-eine-vergleichende-empirische-analyse/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Goodwill-Impairments und Managementwechsel: Eine vergleichende empirische Analyse der DAX-und SMI-Unternehmen, KoR Vol. 20, No. 1 (2020), 22-30","type":"publication"},{"authors":["with Tami Dinh and Seraina Früh"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1531180800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531180800,"objectID":"5b01fa5dbc53bce9d359f781a56be8aa","permalink":"https://mannala.github.io/publication/professional_korruption-im-rahmen-der_accounting_complicance/","publishdate":"2018-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/professional_korruption-im-rahmen-der_accounting_complicance/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Korruption im Rahmen der Accounting Complicance - Theoretische und empirische Einblicke, IRZ Vol. 13, No. 7/8 (2018), 313-315","type":"publication"},{"authors":["with Richard Morris"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527811200,"objectID":"a62547389553d3ee0cfb2d0d755b80a9","permalink":"https://mannala.github.io/publication/the-influence-of-external-control-on-comperative-conditional-conservatism/","publishdate":"2018-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/the-influence-of-external-control-on-comperative-conditional-conservatism/","section":"publication","summary":"We investigate conditional conservatism in a large sample of Australian private companies that use IFRS. We argue, and find, that if private companies are controlled by another (parent) company, these private companies (subsidiaries) display conditional conservatism. We attribute this to the imposition of the parent's accounting policies on its subsidiary (a) because of demands for conditional conservatism from the parent’s shareholders and debtholders and (b) to monitor the subsidiary more closely where greater information asymmetry exists between parent and subsidiary and/or (c) where the subsidiary contributes more important to group earnings. Such conditional conservatism is mitigated substantially if the parent entity is a family or individual. Controlled private companies exhibit similar conditional conservatism to public companies and significantly more conditional conservatism than independent private companies in Australia. Our results are not influenced significantly by tax minimisation, auditor type or dividend policy.","tags":null,"title":"The Influence of External Control on Comperative Conditional Conservatism in Australian Private and Public Companies under IFRS","type":"publication"},{"authors":["with Dirk Hachmeister"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512864000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512864000,"objectID":"76f8a548a1699300ffe2eec6caab4472","permalink":"https://mannala.github.io/publication/professional_kommentierung-zu-297-hgb-bilanzrecht/","publishdate":"2017-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/professional_kommentierung-zu-297-hgb-bilanzrecht/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Kommentierung zu §297 HBG: Inhalt.
