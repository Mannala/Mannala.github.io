In 2007, the FASB issued FIN 48, which mandates the separate disclosure of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs). Tax credits for innovation comprise a significant portion of this reserve because of their higher likelihood of being disallowed by the IRS upon audit. Given that UTB disclosure increases IRS scrutiny and, in consequence, decrease the likelihood of receiving tax credits, we expect net present values of innovation to decrease. Using patent applications as a measure of corporate innovation, we employ a difference-in-difference research design with publicly listed U.S. firms as the treatment group and privately held U.S. firms as the control group. We hypothesize and find robust evidence that following the onset of FIN 48, the number of patent applications by publicly listed firms decreased. We also provide evidence that the decrease is attributable to incremental innovation, which is more subject to the UTB disclosure requirements, and we provide evidence that our findings are more concentrated amongst firms less likely to be audited by the IRS prior to FIN 48. Overall, our evidence provides support for the real effects of disclosures on innovation activities.","tags":["Uncertain tax positions","FIN 48","Radical Innovation","Incremental Innovation","Patents","Backward Citations"],"title":"Financial Statement Tax Disclosures and Corporate Innovation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["with Tami Dinh"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559174400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559174400,"objectID":"a2b8bc499c9f52288eaf9e1c73da32f4","permalink":"https://mannala.github.io/publication/the-real-effect-of-accounting-comperability-on-cross-border-investment/","publishdate":"2019-05-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/the-real-effect-of-accounting-comperability-on-cross-border-investment/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we exploit a quasi-experiment that allows us to identify the effect of an increase in comparability between local GAAP and IFRS on cross-border investment of foreign investors. We find that the increase in accounting comparability after a major GAAP reform in Germany in 2010 leads to an economically large average increase in foreign ownership of about 7 percentage points. Moreover, our results suggest that the increase of cross-border investment fosters industry competition. Our large sample evidence based on both listed and unlisted German firms’ annual shareholder information provides important insights on understanding the effect of a shift towards an accounting regulation that is more comparable to international accounting standards. We contribute to prior research on IFRS adoption by showing that increasing the comparability of local GAAP to IFRS has positive real effects.","tags":null,"title":"The Real Effect of Accounting Comparability on Cross-border Investment of Foreign Investors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["with Terry J.

We extend this finding by developing an approach to estimate the average statutory tax rate from publicly available data that implicitly weights all statutory tax rates a firm is exposed to by the corresponding taxable income. Based on this new approach we decompose tax avoidance into two separate components: tax-rate avoidance and tax-base avoidance. We find that U.S. multinational firms make substantial use of tax-rate avoidance, for instance, their foreign average statutory tax rates decrease from 1988 by 0.6 percentage points each year to around 16 percent in 2014. U.S. domestic firms by definition do not take advantage of low tax rates in non-U.S. countries, however, we find that U.S. domestic firms make substantial use of tax-base avoidance and are more effective in tax-base avoidance than U.S. multinational firms. Overall, our findings on tax-rate and tax-base avoidance of U.S. multinational and domestic firms explain the recent evidence that effective tax rates of domestic firms are at least as low as effective tax rates of multinational firms and substantiate existing doubts that multinational firms, in particular, are the most aggressive tax avoiders.
